# OSX and Sublime Text like keymap for IntelliJ

A keymap, based on the 'default' Mac OS X 10.5 keymap from IntelliJ, which overrides things back to 'normal' OS X keymaps, like top of file with `cmd + up`, delete everything to the beginning of the line with `cmd + backspace` etc. It also set's the keybindings to be comparible with Sublime Text, with some small exceptions.

## Installation instructions

1. If you have IntelliJ running, close it (completely)

2. Clone this repository
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:peterklijn/osx-and-sublime-like-keymap-in-intellij.git
   ```

3. Symlink the XML file you just cloned to this directory (create the `keymaps` folder if it doesn't exist)
   ```
   ln -s \
     ~/path/to/osx-and-sublime-like-keymap-in-intellij/osx-and-sublime-like-keymap.xml \
     ~/Library/Application\ Support/JetBrains/<product><version>/keymaps/.
   ```

4. Start IntelliJ, go to the preferences (`cmd + ,`), go to Keymap, select 'OSX and Sublime Text' in the list of available keymaps.

Tested in IntelliJ IDEA Community 2016.2.1
